Welcome everyone to today's strategy meeting. We'll be discussing the quarterly performance, market expansion, and customer feedback on our AI fitness product, FitFlex.

First, let's review the Q1 financial report. Revenue has increased by 18% compared to Q4 last year. Our subscription model has driven most of the growth, especially in the US and EU markets.

Marketing spend increased by 10%, but our customer acquisition cost dropped by 7%, showing better efficiency in our ad campaigns.

Product development has hit key milestones. The recommendation engine update has led to a 15% increase in user engagement.

Customer feedback indicates that while users love the personalization features, they want more flexibility in choosing workout durations and styles.

Next steps involve improving the mobile app experience, particularly offline mode and syncing with wearables.

Our team should also explore partnerships with wellness brands for cross-promotion. This could significantly increase our reach.

Sales projections for Q2 are optimistic. With targeted campaigns in emerging markets, we expect an additional 12-15% growth.

Let's also address recurring issues raised by users: sync delays, occasional crashes, and lack of multilingual support.

We plan to roll out fixes for these in the upcoming minor releases over the next six weeks.

The meeting wrap-up: Each department should submit an updated roadmap reflecting today's feedback by Friday.

The meeting wrap-up: Each department should submit an updated roadmap reflecting today's feedback by Friday.

Welcome everyone to today's strategy meeting. We'll be discussing the quarterly performance, market expansion, and customer feedback on our AI fitness product, FitFlex.

First, let's review the Q1 financial report. Revenue has increased by 18% compared to Q4 last year. Our subscription model has driven most of the growth, especially in the US and EU markets.

Marketing spend increased by 10%, but our customer acquisition cost dropped by 7%, showing better efficiency in our ad campaigns.

Product development has hit key milestones. The recommendation engine update has led to a 15% increase in user engagement.

Customer feedback indicates that while users love the personalization features, they want more flexibility in choosing workout durations and styles.

Next steps involve improving the mobile app experience, particularly offline mode and syncing with wearables.

Our team should also explore partnerships with wellness brands for cross-promotion. This could significantly increase our reach.

Sales projections for Q2 are optimistic. With targeted campaigns in emerging markets, we expect an additional 12-15% growth.

Let's also address recurring issues raised by users: sync delays, occasional crashes, and lack of multilingual support.

We plan to roll out fixes for these in the upcoming minor releases over the next six weeks.
